Phew! after a lot of nights pulling my hair off &amp; other nights losing hope that I'll ever be able to finish this redesign or even be satisfied by any of the 5+ designs I made/thought of, it's live at last!

This site has reached a point that I couldn't be able to look at it &amp; couldn't say to my self  _"this sucks big time, you have to do something about it. fast."_ Over the last maybe year or more I've designed &amp; sketched no less than 5 designs and even started developing one of them and was really close to go live with it, but everytime something told me _"this is not the right one"._ By the way, there won't be a right design, especially if you are designing for yourself I even tweeted about it.

Usually you start thinking that this is an easy task. I know what I want and I can pull it off cause I have the skills. No, you are completely wrong, cause while you are designing or developing your own site you will usually find a new technique or something that you will want to try on your site (it's my site &amp; also it acts as a playground were I can test new stuff without worrying too much about an angry client or manager) plus, you will always want it to be perfect _"a myth"._ So when you are 80% satisfied, go live cause if you don't, you will never will. And that's what I did.

I'm not 100% satisfied but I'm ok with it now and I like it, I'll keep editing though along the way &amp; improve on it. But at least I have something I can be proud of now.

### About this redesign

* This site is responsive. (go check it on your smartphones, tablets &amp; some less capable phones) I don't have much devices to test on, but _[any testing is better than no testing](http://adactio.com/journal/5433/)._ So I made my tests on my iPhone (iOS), my Mom's Nokia Lumia (Windows phone) &amp; my old Nokia C5 using Opera mini. <img src="/assets/img/content/test-lab.jpg" alt="" title="test-lab" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840" />

<div style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-full wp-image-834 " title="iphone" src="/assets/img/content/iphone.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="180"><p class="wp-caption-text">iOS Icon</p></div>
* 90% JavaScript free I didn't wrote a single line of JavaScript, I only used [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) &amp; used a fix for the iOS orientation bug and ([Selectivizr](http://selectivizr.com/) &amp; [Respond JS](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) to Patch IE8 &amp;  7). If you are using a modern browser you will be getting a JavaScript free version(Modernizr only).
* It was built using a custom responsive 4 columns grid.
* WordPress is the CMS.
* HTML5-ied (still needs some cleaning).
* CSS was written using SCSS flavour of [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).
* Fonts used: [Proxima Nova](https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova) for body type &amp; [Proxima Nova Condensed](https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova-condensed) for headlines served from [Typekit](https://typekit.com).
