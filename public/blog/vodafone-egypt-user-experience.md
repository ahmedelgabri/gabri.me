Last week I changed my mobile phone plan then after a couple of days I found that my 3G connection is not working anymore. So I went to a Vodafone office to see what's wrong, the surprise was that since I changed my plan Vodafone actually **deleted my previous profile** and created a new one with the new plan! And this disabled my iPhone internet plan that I was using so that's why the 3G was not working not only this but the customer service representative dialed a wrong code to activate my internet plan again which costed me to pay 75 pounds that I shouldn't have paid in the first place, nice!

So today I woke up and wanted to check my mobile phone balance and stuff, cause I have changed my plane recently. So I headed to [http://www.vodafone.com.eg](http://www.vodafone.com.eg/) to log in &amp; check my line. But I the surprise that I was faced by this beautiful message whenever I tried to log in!

<p class="wp-caption-text">WTH!</p>

Then I tweeted this for them

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">WTH!!! <a href="http://t.co/Tjnvuzul" title="http://cl.ly/3S3x1Z2s3V2i0p3J2k2C">cl.ly/3S3x1Z2s3V2i0p…</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/VodafoneEgypt">VodafoneEgypt</a>

Then they replied and asked for my number and I DMed it to them. After a couple of hours I got a call from the Customer service to discuss my problem and it went like this:

<dl>
<dt>CS:</dt>
<dd>Hi you have contacted us through twitter regarding a problem with your profile on our website, how can I help you and can you tell me exactly what is the problem?</dd>
<dt>Me:</dt>
<dd>Hi, thanks for calling. The problem that I already had an account before but now when I try to log in it told me I can't cause I have changed my plan?!</dd>
<dt>CS:</dt>
<dd>Actually yes since you have changed your plan we deleted your account and you have to create a new one instead, So what is the problem exactly?</dd>
<dt>Me:</dt>
<dd>What! What is the problem?! the problem is that I need to create a new account for an account I already had?! this line is 13yrs old line so why I have to create a new account for it now? Sorry, but your system is stupid, this doesn't make any sense! Why not just update my profile with my new plan?</dd>
<dt>CS:</dt>
<dd>Cause that's how the system works &amp; we can't do anything about it &amp; I'm not a technical person to know about this stuff but if it was possible to be implemented I'm sure the IT stuff would have made possible.</dd>
<dt>Me:</dt>
<dd>are you kidding?! possible?! Sure it is possible. you are not a technical person but I am one &amp; I'm telling you that IT IS POSSIBLE.</dd>
</dl>

....The conversation went like this for like 30mins trying to convince him that it's a mistake &amp; he can't even see why it's a big deal to create a new account, he even said "what is the big deal to create a new profile? how this is a problem for you, I can't understand?" and that this is a strategic decision to make to change the system! the funny part that he even told me that he can create an account for me but he will need me to do some steps like filling the verification code that the system will send to me **and Call 5090 to verify the creation of the new account**, Really I have to call a number to verify my online account?! what is this 2012 B.C.?! I finished the call in huge frustration.

Then I went to create the stupid account filled my info and on purpose I didn't called the number to see what will happened if I didn't call that number and here is what I got

If you read the note underneath the error it doesn't make any sense? how can a fraud calls claiming that they are Vodafone be minimized by adding an uncecssary step of calling a number to activate my account? Shouldn't this be something related to _Why you are annoying the hell out of me to call you to activate my online account instead of this bla bla bla?_.

To Sum this out here are some points you have to take in mind if you are Vodafone or a startup (If you are a startup people might be even a bit forgivable)

1. **DON'T** delete a user profile for an active user cause he just changed a service/plan/whatever.
2. **DON'T** make a user call a number to activate his account (I still can't get the point of this step, it's just beyond me!)
3. **Do** the heavy lifting &amp; always sympathize with your users (creating new account &amp; filing forms online is not a fun thing to do)

How can this be fixed:

1. Again, DON'T delete a user profile for an active user cause he just changed a service/plan/whatever. Just update his privileges instead or if you can't tell them frankly what's going to happened. Don't surprise them.
2. Don't use Mobile numbers to log in cause phone numbers are accessible to everyone use email/username instead (I might be using a secret email for registering online that no one knows but everyone knows my phone number)
3. Hire better developer/designers and a company that is very huge like Vodafone should have a UX designer!
4. DON'T make a user call a number to activate his online account!

This wasn't about UX online only it was the whole experience on/offline for one of the biggest companies in the world. And also this is for all Egyptian companies cause they really do need us to talk more about this cause simply they don't care about their users. They just abuse us and take our money and in return we get a bad service/customer service/ experience.
Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading.
