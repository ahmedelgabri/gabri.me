After a huge work  i'm proud to present my new design, it took me so long to to complete it and make it work!. Cause it's my 1st time ever to use Wordpress so it was a challenge.

It took me a while to understand how Wordpress works and how does the template system works but i a managed to understand it to very well yet but sure better than before , Actually when i understand how it works it was overwhelming cause the probabilities are endless and the sky is the limit _especially for PHP developers_.

<u>So getting back to the redesign process i mainly had 2 goals:</u>

1. To make something that represent who i am & what i like _i like blue_ it's obvious and _simple designs_.
2. to have a blog and this has 2 sub-goals
    1. Improve my technical skills and to gain feedback.
    2. Improve my English cause since i finished school i didn't talk or write in English regularly enough and i found myself heavily depending on Firefox to fix my spelling errors ,sad but true.
    3. Write and express myself with words cause i'm a shy person & can't express with words well.

I chose to go crazy with HTML5 , CSS3 & @font-face (check the [404 page](http://www.gabri.me/404)) , yes yes i know both of them are not yet finished and the browser support etc.. . but since this is my playground i wanted to experiment , at first i was going to use [Elliot Jay Stocks Starkers](http://elliotjaystocks.com/starkers/) but then he made a post about [Nathan Staines Starkers HTML5](http://nathanstaines.com/archive/starkers-html5) so i downloaded and read the Codex and started designing.

The Blog was completely designed in the browser cause i didn't know exactly what Wordpress tags will give me or what can or can't achieve with it so it was a trial and error part and actually i think it's the best part of the site .  at this point you must know that IE6 is not supported although it looks ok in it , only a glitch or two that need to be fixed & weird bug at the contact page - i don't think it's a Peek-a-boo bug - cause i tried nearly every solution on the web with no luck . anyway it degrades gracefully for other browsers .

at last i have to give credit to [Jim Loy](http://www.jimloy.com/) for letting me using one of his fonts.

so feel free to tell me what do you think about it , also any bug reports are welcome .

**Update :** i got many feedbacks regarding the blue color as a background and about typography problems so i decided to change the color scheme to a nicer and clearer one i hope this one is better.
